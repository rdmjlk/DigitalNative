        As I contemplated the topic for my data project, I began to reflect on the purpose of AI tools and my own interests and design practices. Since my conceptual thinking is not very far along, I find it easier to approach the assignment from the perspective of my own practice as a designer. 
        
        One aspect of AI that I find intriguing is its attempt to mimic the data it has been given as accurately as possible. Currently, AI's primary goal is to perfect the resemblance of human features. However, I have noticed that most images of humans still appear artificial and lack the physicality that would make them more lifelike.

        <h2>The first week. Images and possibilites</h2>
        <p>The first week started with good vibes. This is my first time working with brief-based assignments, so I tried to pay as much attention as possible. Conceptual thinking when approaching to. A design project is completely new to me. What it seems is that theres more attention paid to the idea of the” Why” question more into the process of designing. I rarely do conceptual thinking when it comes to my design process. This is usually reserved for artwork projects, but it is interesting to reflect on these subjects in a design context. My process is usually practice-based, but I wish The first assignment already started to challenge my usual practice. Reflecting on what context the AI. I usually work with moving images when it comes to works, but I want to use this course as a chance to see what I can do.

        <h2>Labeling / Adjutating</h2>
        <p>Adudating images was a new feeling for me that I had not experienced before. When I eventually got out of the labeling dilemma that I had in my hands, I started to enjoy the labelling process quite a bit. Due to the nature of my images, the repetition became very big. Part of my labeling process, where I didnt need to stay too long for each of the photos. When repetition was added I stopped each photo for so long and just started to continue and continue labelling. At the end of the process, I was left with calm, but still a bit uncertain feelings due to the beginning bumps. 
        </p>

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>After the labeling was done, I moved into choosing the way of replicating the data set that I had trained. The faces themselves werent the subject matter that I was interested in photos. It was the momentary distortion that was happening due to momentary strong physical force. I felt that using straight-up faces would have been too easy and I did not want to force faces through distortion through synthesis. If I was going to artificially create distortion, I could have gone all the way with it. For those reasons, I decided to use Blender and After Effects as my main tools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started by making a still image in Blender and then adjusting its nature by modifying it even more in Photoshop. The first experiences were interesting but did not create results that I felt represented the nature of the original photos. Therefore I continued the process even further. I tried to create a similar type of wear and tear that skin usually has.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The still photos were interesting experimentation, but I felt were lacked something. When I received the first versions from the test of the algorithm reacting to the photos I felt a bit underwhelmed. The algorithm did not seem to respond and recognize my own perception when I saw the dataset photos for the first time. This drove me to use one of my still images as a base for my video.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, I was way more pleased with the results that I received from the video, but I was still happy to go through and produce the still images. It gave me a lot of interesting comparison points with the video. The production phase itself felt rewarding, but I feel like I underdetermined the amount of work that was being processed, and for the next adaptations, I would like to use more time experimenting with different techniques and materials.</p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>The feedback that I received from the final outputs was interesting. I have never participated in such open dialogue about each others work, and also given straight feedback. The whole workshop lasted only a couple of days but I was happy with the final product that I had made.</p>
        
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The duration of the workshop was one of the first ones where I have conceptually challenged myself in a real meaningful way. It was an interesting first attempt at flexing my muscles while working with object recognition systems. </p>
        <p>The workshop forced me to dig deeper inside of my own emotional response to the images that I got. At first, I felt that I was walking in tar, not getting the idea of what they were trying to get out of me. This became apparent, especially in the labeling phase. In retrospect, I should have not thought about my choices that much and shifted my focus from the nature of the images to their behavior.</p>
